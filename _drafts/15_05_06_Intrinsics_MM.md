# SSE intrinsics MindMap

While working on my thesis I found out that it's really hard to find intrinsic 
you need from Intel's official [guide](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/), especially if 
you are new in this field.

In order to be able to handle such amount of information I made a MindMap of intrinsics. It covers only SSE - SSE4.2 
while MMX is considered deprecated nowadays and AVX is not available on all machines (on mine, for example). I thought this 
might be helpful for others too.
