[Covert and side channels due to processor architecture](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSAC.2006.20) - Wang et al. @ ACSAC 2006

The paper looks into at-that-time-emerging microarchitectural features and analyses how they could be used for side channels attacks. It is one of the earliest papers on microarchitectural SCA, although not the first one.

Contributions:
- Proposes two new side channels based on SMT: a concurrent L1D channel and execution port contention.
- Foreshadows future attacks that rely on speculation. Althought the description is a bit vague, they mention some bits and pieces of both Spectre and Meltdown.
It reads more like a side note, though.
- Proposes a side-channel protected cache design (RPCache).

IMO, the main contribution of this paper was showing how fast and effective cache side channels could be.
They measured L1D channel as 3.2 Mbps and execution port contention channel - 500 kbps.
It was a huge increase compared to older SCAs such as power analysis.
