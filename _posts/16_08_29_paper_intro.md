Inspired by [the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/), I'm going to try writing short summaries to the papers I find interesting and important. The posts will be under 500 words long to keep it fast and clean. And it won't be daily --- at best, I can handle one paper per week, probably posting every Friday. 

The topics will be centered around security and fault tolerance, though some other fields may appear as well.

As usual, if you like what I'm doing, please let me know by commenting or by sharing.

Thanks,
Alex
