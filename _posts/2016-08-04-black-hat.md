Here are the presentations from this year's Black Hat I particularly want to watch:

* [A lightbulb worm?](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#a-lightbulb-worm) A attack on a lightbulb. On a freaking lightbulb. I think, it already makes it worth watching.
* [Advanced CAN injection techniques for Vehicle Networks.](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#advanced-can-injection-techniques-for-vehicle-networks) The CAN bus is famous for being outdated and having lots of issues on different levels. Security is one of them. This talk shows ways of bypassing the existing protection mechanisms and gaining significant portion of control over a car.
* [Breaking kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) with Intel TSX.](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#breaking-kernel-address-space-layout-randomization-kaslr-with-intel-tsx) Intel keeps providing us with new processor extensions that are supposed to either make our lives as developers easier or to make some things faster. But they also change the security playground and this talk discusses how one of this extensions can be used in a bad ways.
* [Cyber war in perspective analysis from the crisis in Ukraine.](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#cyber-war-in-perspective-analysis-from-the-crisis-in-ukraine) We keeps hearing about this "cyber war" thing in the news nowadays, but how does it look like in reality? And does it even exist?
* [Demystifying the secure enclave processor.](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#demystifying-the-secure-enclave-processor) The Apple SEP exists for a while already, but little is known about it. This presentation discusses its internals and potential ways to attack it.
* [SGX secure enclaves in practice: security and crypto review.](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#sgx-secure-enclaves-in-practice-security-and-crypto-review) Another Intel extension - SGX - is so popular nowadays that I simply couldn't miss this talk.
