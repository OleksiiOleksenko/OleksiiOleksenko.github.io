In recent years, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has gained a lot of popularity. The key idea behind NFV is to leverage standard IT virtualization technology to virtualize different classes of network devices and use them as flexible building blocks that can be easily managed. NFV has all chances of becoming a major trend in future information networks because it solves a lot of communication issues, such as resource sharing, isolation, and resource aggregation. Moreover, modern processors are now so fast that it is possible to design networking devices using software modules that run on standard processors. It will not only significantly reduce equipment cost and maintenance efforts but will also give us the ability to run virtually any application on these network devices. This, in turn, means that in future general-purpose computational resources will be available at the very edge of the network---on the communication devices. Furthermore, even traditional routers, such as Cisco IOx-enabled routers, are becoming capable of running commodity applications by virtualizing a Guest Operating System. The concept of performing computation at the logical extreme of the network is known as **Edge Computing** (also, Fog Computing) and popularization of NFV makes it realistic.
