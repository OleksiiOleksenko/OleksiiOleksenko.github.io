[Commercial Fault Tolerance: A Tale of Two Systems](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.133.8058) - by Bartlett et al.

The paper is a comparison of fault tolerance designs and characteristics of two most popular high availability server series: the IBM zSeries of mainframes and the HP NonStop servers. It concentrates on one main question: how these two series achieve Continuous Availability, i.e. minimization of both scheduled maintenance time and time spend on unexpected outages.
