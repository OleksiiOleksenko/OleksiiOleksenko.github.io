Motivation: having specialized hardware for networking is expensive and hard to maintain. It would be much better to have network services to be executed on commodity servers. 

Orthogonal to SDN.

Benefits: increased Time to Marked (no need for new hardware, just a software update). Multi-tenancy (share resources across services and customers). Elastic scaling. Easier path to market (small startups, academia).

Challenges: high performance portable network virtualization; backward compatibility with hardware; interoperability - VM from different vendors.

Definition: network functions implemented in software running on standard servers

TODO: add link to NFV white paper
