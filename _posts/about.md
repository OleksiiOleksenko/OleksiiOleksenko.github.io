Title: About
Heading: Hello! 
Subheading: My Name is Oleksii Oleksenko <br/> I am a Computer Science PhD student and a Python developer
Template: landing

I mainly specialize in fault tolerant and secure applications, but also work quite a lot with web, IT operations (recently, it's Docker) and with many other things. I also do some teaching in TU Dresden.

Previously, I received my Master Degree in  Distributed Systems Engineering from the TU Dresden in 12/2015. And prior to that, I received a Master Degree in Telecommunications from NTUU "KPI". 

Although, I am currently working on comparing and improving existing memory protection mechanisms, the overall topic of my PhD will be in the domain of Fault Tolerance and Real-Time systems.
