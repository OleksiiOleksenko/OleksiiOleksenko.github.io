    abstract = { Hardware faults can cause data corruptions during computation, and they are especially harmful if these corruptions happen in data pointers. Existing solutions, however, incur high performance overheads, which is unacceptable for compute-intensive applications. In this work, we present an efficient fault-tolerance approach against hardware faults by exploiting the new extensions to the x86 architecture. In particular, we propose that Intel MPX can be effectively used to detect faults in data pointers, while Intel TSX can provide roll-back recovery against these corruptions. Our preliminary evaluation supports this hypothesis, and we estimate the average overhead to be roughly around 50%.},

    abstract = {Nowadays, database systems pursuit a main memory-centric architecture, where the entire business-related data is stored and processed in a compressed form in main memory. In this case, the performance gain is massive because database operations can benefit from its higher bandwidth and lower latency. However, current main memory-centric database systems utilize general-purpose error detection and correction solutions to address the emerging problem of increasing dynamic error rate of main memory. The costs of these generalpurpose methods dramatically increases with increasing error rates. To reduce these costs, we have to exploit context knowledge of database systems for resiliency. Therefore, we introduce our vision of resiliency-aware data compression in this paper, where we want to exploit the benefits of both fields in an integrated approach with low performance and memory overhead. In detail, we present and evaluate a first approach using AN encoding and two different compression schemes to show the potentials and challenges of our vision. }
